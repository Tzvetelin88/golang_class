1. GO is not OOP by nature!

1. Commands: 
    - go run
    - go build
    - go fmt

2. What kind of Packages 
    - executable - file that we can run
    - reusable - reusable logic, not to run, helper functions etc.

3. Packages and Imports: 
 - package is our main package like "main". It's like project or workspaces that can contain many other files.
 - imports give "main" access to our imports like: "fmt", "calculator", "uploader" etc.

4.  Arrays vs Slices - Every element of Slices must be of the same type!


Dynamically Typed - JS and Python (do not care about type of variable)
Statically Typed - C++, Java, GO
